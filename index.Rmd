# Hi, I'm Yan Wang.

I am [Yan Wang](https://github.com/Vialawaila) from Beijing, China<i class="fas fa-home"></i> .
I am now in Beijing but live based on Pacific Time Zone. Although most my courses this quarter are prerecorded, I still want to keep the jet lag to avoid assignment overdue. It is my pleasure to spend this special quarter with you. Nice to meet you! 

I am a second-year economics and geography double major student. I declared my second major, geography with a geographic information science emphasis, in spring 2020. That thought, major in geography, did cross my mind earlier, and I was encouraged and finally put it into action after took several geography courses at UCSB. I enjoy both of my majors.

It is a special and challenging quarter that different from the previous in-person lectures. It is new for me and for everyone, but I believe we have the ability to handle it. I'm so excited about this quarter, and I hope we can have a wonderful time together.

In course GEOG 176A this summer quarter, I learned some basic skills in Geographic Information Systems and Science. Although they are basic, it will help me to develop my Economic Geography study. Operating Geographic Information Systems and Science will helps me to elaborate my thesis when I am doing research on Economic Geography. It provides direct evidences showing the relationships between variables. With GIS, data structure allows me to draw meaningful conclusions from the data easier.
